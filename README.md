# Simple_convolution

A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

On this case, I use a simple pass through the image to extract some characteristics (on this case vertical and horizontal lines) with the following filters:

After we upload an image like this one:

We get an output like this:
